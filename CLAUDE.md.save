# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an AWS SAP (Solutions Architect Professional) exam study resource repository containing HTML-based learning materials. The repository serves as a comprehensive visual learning platform with infographics, technical diagrams, and detailed explanations of AWS services and concepts.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into topical categories:

- `networking/` - Networking services (Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, VPN, PrivateLink, EIP/NAT)
- `transit-gateway-sharing/` - Transit Gateway and AWS RAM sharing resources  
- `security-governance/` - Security and governance services (SCP, IAM, WAF, Tag Policies)
- `compute-applications/` - Compute and application services (EC2, Lambda, EFA, Auto Scaling)
- `content-delivery-dns/` - Content delivery and DNS services (CloudFront, Route53)
- `development-deployment/` - Development and deployment services (CloudFormation Service Catalog)
- `index.html` - Main navigation interface with sidebar navigation

## Architecture

### Navigation System
- `index.html` serves as the main entry point with a collapsible sidebar navigation
- Each category in the sidebar dynamically loads HTML content using iframe injection
- JavaScript functions handle category expansion/collapse and content loading

### Content Structure  
- Each HTML file is a self-contained learning module with:
  - Embedded SVG diagrams and technical illustrations
  - Step-by-step explanations with numbered sections
  - AWS CLI examples and code snippets
  - Responsive CSS using AWS brand colors (#232F3E, #FF9900)
  - Japanese language content optimized for Japanese learners

### File Patterns
- HTML files use descriptive naming: `aws-[service]-[topic].html` or `[service]_[topic]_infographic.html`
- All content is static HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no external dependencies
- SVG graphics are inline for offline accessibility

## Working with Content

### Adding New Learning Resources
1. Create HTML file following existing naming conventions
2. Use consistent CSS styling with AWS brand colors
3. Include SVG diagrams for visual explanation
4. Update `index.html` navigation to include new resource
5. Place file in appropriate topical directory

### Modifying Navigation
- Update `index.html` sidebar structure to add/remove categories
- Modify `loadContent()` function calls to match new file paths
- Ensure category organization aligns with AWS SAP exam domains

### File Organization
- When reorganizing files, update all references in `index.html`
- Maintain logical grouping by AWS service domains
- Remove any `.html:Zone.Identifier` files that may appear from Windows downloads

## Git Operations and Version Control

### Repository Management
- This repository uses Git for version control and change tracking
- User identity is configured as: suzuki100603@gmail.com (Suzuki)
- All changes should be committed with descriptive messages in Japanese or English

### Commit Guidelines
- Make atomic commits for logical changes (single feature/fix per commit)
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of changes
- Include both English and Japanese descriptions when helpful for learning context
- Commit messages should follow the format: `[Type]: Brief description`
  - Types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `refactor` (code restructuring)

### Branching Strategy
- Use `master` branch for stable content
- Create feature branches for significant additions: `feature/[service-name]` or `feature/[topic]`
- Merge completed features back to master after review

### Change Tracking Best Practices
- Commit frequently to track incremental progress on learning materials
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files, OS-specific files, and build artifacts
- Tag major milestones (e.g., completion of service categories): `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Complete networking section"`

### File Management
- Always commit changes after adding new learning resources
- Update navigation and references in the same commit when adding new files
- Remove outdated or duplicate content through Git operations to maintain history
